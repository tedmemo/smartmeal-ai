## üîë Adding Your OpenAI API Key

This app does **not** include any OpenAI API key in the codebase for security reasons. To use AI-powered features (meal planning, chat, etc.), you must add your own API key after deploying or cloning the app.

### How to Add Your API Key

1. **Deploy or run the app** (locally or on Vercel).
2. **Click the Settings (gear) icon** in the top-right corner, or use the yellow banner at the top if prompted.
3. **Paste your OpenAI API key** in the modal and save.
4. Your key is stored **only in your browser** (localStorage) and is never sent to any server or included in the code.
5. You can remove or update your key at any time from the same Settings modal.

> **Tip:** You can get your OpenAI API key from [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Why This is Secure
- No API key is ever committed to the repo or sent to a server.
- Each user controls their own key in their browser.
- Safe for public forks, deployment, and open source use.
